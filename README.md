# EECS 731 Project 1
*Grant Gollier*

My goal for this project was to combine datasets around all the hospitals in the United States and Census population density.
I was curious about the number of people per hospital as well as any other cool insights I could gain from combining hospital data with other
demographic information.

To see my analysis checkout the [1-Exploratory-Analysis Notebook](notebooks/1-Exploratory-Analysis.ipynb).

The `requirements.txt` file is a bit overkill as I just saved the whole standard Anaconda environment for Python 3.8. Realistically, all that's needed is Pandas, NumPy, Basemap, and the Basemap High Res data.
